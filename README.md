# 100-Days-of-Python
This is a repository for 100 Python projects I've made to help learn Python.

I found a course on Udemy called 100 days of Python. These are the projects from that course. Most will be fairly simple projects as the early part of the course was to teach the basics of python. 

As I moved into the more intermediate projects, I am mostly just looking at the final product and working out how to create it myself.
